Welcome to compressor app!
The given text file must be in CZECH language with diacritics! In other way the program will not work properly!
Everything necessary is set in config.ini file, which can be found in folder config/config.ini
For user are parts "USER-STATIC" - basic set up and "USER-LOG" - for print specific informations from log file.
1. "[USER-STATIC]":
text_file_path = write a path of the text file, which you want to compress.
path_to_save_output_files = write a path of dictionary, where should be all outputs files(compressed text file and additional files) saved.
name_of_final_text_file = write name of final compressed text file
2. "[USER-LOG]":
wants_print_logs = choose if you actually want to print any logs
                options: "Y" - yes, "N" - no
Filter by when the log information/change of compression was made.
start_date_time = choose starting date time in format "Y-m-d H:M:S" of range logs
                options: format date time (for example: "2024-01-09 20:36:08"), "last_run" - filter only logs from the last run, "None" - you don't care about this option, log informations will not be filtered by this value
end_date_time = choose ending date time in format "Y-m-d H:M:S" of range logs
                options: format date time (for example: "2024-01-09 20:36:08"), "last_run" filter only logs from the last run, "None" - you don't care about this option, log informations will not be filtered by this value
    note: If you want to filter log informations by date time, you must set both variables "start_date_time" and also "end_date_time" with same type of values
Filter by how good was change of compression evaluated by score. (from "0" to positive numbers)
min_score = choose minimum of range score
                options: number (for example: "6", "0"), "None" - you don't care about this option, log informations will not be filtered by this value
max_score = choose maximum of range score
                options: number (for example: "12", "5"), "None" - you don't care about this option, log informations will not be filtered by this value
    note: If you want to filter log informations by the score, you must set both variables "min_score" and also "max_score" with same type of values
type_of_change = choose which type of change compression was made
                options: "shorted", "replaced", "symbolized", "None" - you don't care about this option, log informations will not be filtered by this value
The compressed text file, which can be readen, will be in directory, which you set in config.ini with additional files like abbreviations dictionary and symbols dictionary.
This files you must use to properly read the compressed text file.
